### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The Explore US Bikeshare Data project lets user explore data from bikeshare systems in three cities from the US (New York City, Chicago and Washington D.C.)

When running the code. It interacts with the user asking for the city for which he wants to explore the data. Then it asks for the time-period the user wants to explore it can be:
- A concrete month or all the months
- A concrete day of the week or all the days.

Then the code prints the results.

Once the code has printed the results, it asks the user if he wants to explore the raw data by showing 5 rows at a time till the user is done. Then it asks the user if he wants to run again the code from the begining.
